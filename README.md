# BCS_Homework_1

<BCS_Homework_1> is a project where I worked with Horiseon Marketing Agency to refactor the code of their website.  They wanted to ensure that the codebase meets accessibility standards so that it is optimized for search engines, while maintaining the presentation of the original layout.  



# Accessibility
The main thing I did to meet accessibility standards was replace nearly all div tags with semantic HTML tags ( nav, main, aside, etc) This allowed an accessibility reader to properly identify different sections of the Horiseon website

I also added alt tags to images so that a description could be read via the accessibility reader.

I also updated the title element to give the website an actual name besides "website"



# CSS

I updated the semantic structure of the CSS file so that elements and properties were listed in the order they appear in the index file.

I consolidated the CSS code of all classes with identical properties for easier viewing

I left comments throughout CSS file

# Thank You!!!
I want to thank the instructors, TAs, and my fellow classmates for all of the resources they have shared to make this project go much smoother than if I did it by myself! One assignment down, on to the next...
